# MERN CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN stack.

## Overview

This application demonstrates basic CRUD operations on a MongoDB database using a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js. The frontend is built with React.js to provide a user interface for interacting with the backend API.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new items to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display items from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing items in the database.
- **Delete**: Remove items from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the RESTful API.
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side code.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for styling the frontend.
